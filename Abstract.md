## Abstract
The Interactive Kea project intends to create a system that allows the Cincinnati zoo guests to interact with the Kea birds by playing a game together. The Kea are intelligent birds capable of continuously learning new activities. The project will reward the Kea for their efforts while simultaneously collecting data for research.  The data gathered will allow the Cincinnati Zookeepers to learn potentially new things regarding the Kea. The system will need to be safe to interact with for both the guests of all ages and for the Kea. The system itself will consist of one monitor for the guests and one for the birds, allowing them to interact at the same time.

Test Case 1 – Setting Up Buttons and Relay
1.	Setting Up Buttons and Relay
2.	The purpose of this test was to make sure the Raspberry Pi was correctly reading a button push and controlling the relay properly.
3.	This test was to help determine if the code and hardware were working together to allow the game to be played. The code had to make sure the correct pins were set to be an input or output. The buttons were all inputs on the Raspberry Pi and the Relay was an output.
4.	The inputs on the Raspberry Pi were the buttons. For the pi to read a button press there had to be 3.3VDC on the Pi’s pins. The button was setup so that when the button was pressed the voltage would be disconnected to the pin. Within the code we were looking for the that change in voltage to determine when a button was pressed.
5.	To start off we setup the code so that when a button was pressed then the relay would turn on. Though the test we could make sure that the pi was controlling the relay as expected. During the test we did see the correct output response we were looking for.
6.	This test allowed us to see the performance of the pi when a button was pressed. At first during this test one hurdle that had to be overcome was finding a library that allowed us to read the GPIO.

Test Case 2 – Wiring was Correct for the Hardware
1.	Wiring was Correct for the Hardware
2.	This test was to determine if all the wiring was correct for the hardware.
3.	To conduct this, test a voltmeter and instruction manuals of the hardware were used to see the proper way some hardware had to be wired.
4.	The inputs for this test was the input voltage for each device. For example, all the LED’s ran on 12VDC also, the Raspberry Pi had a 3.3VDC output that was used. It is important that the device was powered by the correct voltage because if not the electronics would no longer work. If 120VAC was applied to the LED’s then the LED’s would no longer work.
5.	The expected results for the test was that all the positive and negative leads were landed correctly, and that each device was powered by the correct voltage. 
6.	This test to make sure that all the devices were functioning properly, and that no device were connected to the wrong voltage. By testing the voltage before connecting the device it made it easier to not destroy the electronics. It was also important to pay attention to the user manual of the devices to know where the positive and negative leads needed to be landed.

# Total Combined Project Hours:
## Fall Group activities: Approximately 25 hours (included in our individual totals, all hours are approximate)
Once we created a group, we took a few (3) hours to brainstorm and review our project ideas. Once we agreed on a project we sought out a project advisor (2). We met with our projet advisor on four in person occasions, lasting an hour or two (4-8). As a group, we spent a Saturday afternoon at the zoo (5-6) to get  to know the Kea, Zoo staff, and learn our way around the Kea enclosure. We used thhis time to ask questions and familarize ourselves with the surroundings. Next, we brainstormed as a group our options for what our project should do (5-6), this step took multiple meetings and emails with or advisor. Once we agreed on a plan, we began to break the project into smaller tasks that we could work on indivudally(2-3). 
## Spring Group Activites Approximately 25 hours (included in our individual totals, all hours are approximate)
As a group, we continued to be in contact with our advisor and our Zoo contact via email (5). We also all had a hand in creating our final video presentation and demo of our working project (15). This included gathering and updating our information, writing and rehersing our speech, and editing the videos. As a group, creating our final expo information was one our largest efforts this semester. We were all also responsible for working on our self assements papers (2). Finally, as a group we worked together to create some test cases that would be performed on our system (3-5).

## Annie Meyer
### Fall Hours: Approximately 50 (25 group + 25 indivudal)
Aside from the group effort, I was responsible for creating a timeline and keeping us on track (12). This involved completing and turning in the group assignments as well as checking in with everyone to ensure everyone had a task and was not being held up by another task. This was my biggest responsibility across both semesters as I was ensuring we kept moving and completed all deadlines with all requirements. Many of the hours in this activity came from working on the group assignments and revises them with input from the group. I also worked with Jake to do research on what type of game and software could be used to play with the Kea (5). The type of game that we wanted to use went through a few different phases, from Simon Says to Pong. I also spent time researching the Kea with Jake and Joe to ensure that the materials we were using were not harmful, as well as what was known about the Kea and what they were capable of interacting with (3). We worked with the Zoo stuff to understand what type of perch is safe for the birds and gain some insight on what could be considered bird safe.
### Spring Hours: Approximately 50 (25 group + 25 indivudal)
#### I continued to be responsible for our assignments and timeline this semester (12). I ensured that we kept our information up to date, met our timelines, and created group meetings. This includes compiling the information required for our expo information and our final report documentation as well. I was also largely responsible for creating our final presentation poster (10). I created our draft and final copy, with the help and edits from my group. I also participated in documenting and performing software tests (3-5).
### Year Total: Approximately 100 (50 group + 50 individual)

## Jake Sebald
### Fall Hours: Approximately 50 (25 group + 25 indivudal)
#### As mentioned previously under Annie's hours, we worked together on researching the game (5) and researching bird safe options for the Kea (3). Everyone helped Annie with input in the group assignments throughout the semester as well (4-6). One of my main responsibilities in the fall was to work on the reward system (8), I had help from Zach and Joe in this area as well. We learned from the Zoo staff that they would like to reward the birds in some manner, we discussed a few different options such as a food or some other treat. Ultimately we learned that without tagging the birds with an RFID chip, it will be difficult to reward the birds indivudally. My other responsibility was to research possible behavioral data collection (5-6). Again, we decided without tracking the birds we cannot track indivudal behavioral data. We could however track and record interactions as a whole and learn about the Kea in this manner.

## Joe Leanza
### Fall Hours: Approximately 50 (25 group + 25 indivudal)
#### I participated in a portion of the group assignments for this semester (4-6). I also helped Jake on researching the rewards system (4). My main responsibility for this semester was to work on designing the console and helping decide what parts needed to be purchased to construct the console (15). I did research into having it 3D printed and after discovering a budgetting issue, determined that we would need to construct a wooden console. I built a new design and determined what parts would need to be purchased. I also helped Jake and Annie visit the Zoo to determine what type of perch would be considered bird safe (3).

#### Some of my hours came from working on the group assignments (4-6). Alongside this, I worked alongside Jake and Joe on researching the rewards sytem (4). One of my main roles was organizing our budget and ordering all of the appropriate parts (17). This included searching for various parts and ensuring they would all work together as well as completing the reimbursment paperwork. This also includes m y work in designing the electrical schmetaic and determing what parts would be needed.

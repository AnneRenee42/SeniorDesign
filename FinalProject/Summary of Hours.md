# Total Combined Project Hours:
## Fall Group activities: Approximately 25 hours (included in our individual totals, all hours are approximate)
Once we created a group, we took a few (3) hours to brainstorm and review our project ideas. Once we agreed on a project we sought out a project advisor (2). We met with our projet advisor on four in person occasions, lasting an hour or two (4-8). As a group, we spent a Saturday afternoon at the zoo (5-6) to get  to know the Kea, Zoo staff, and learn our way around the Kea enclosure. We used thhis time to ask questions and familarize ourselves with the surroundings. Next, we brainstormed as a group our options for what our project should do (5-6), this step took multiple meetings and emails with or advisor. Once we agreed on a plan, we began to break the project into smaller tasks that we could work on indivudally(2-3). 
## Spring Group Activites

## Annie Meyer
### Fall Hours: Approximately 50 (25 group + 25 indivudal)
Aside from the group effort, I was responsible for creating a timeline and keeping us on track (12). This involved completing and turning in the group assignments as well as checking in with everyone to ensure everyone had a task and was not being held up by another task. This was my biggest responsibility across both semesters as I was ensuring we kept moving and completed all deadlines with all requirements. Many of the hours in this activity came from working on the group assignments and revises them with input from the group. I also worked with Jake to do research on what type of game and software could be used to play with the Kea (5). The type of game that we wanted to use went through a few different phases, from Simon Says to Pong. I also spent time researching the Kea with Jake to ensure that the materials we were using were not harmful, as well as what was known about the Kea and what they were capable of interacting with (3). We worked with the Zoo stuff to understand what type of perch is safe for the birds and gain some insight on what could be considered bird safe.

#### As mentioned previously under Annie's hours, we worked together on researching the game (5) and researching bird safe options for the Kea (3). Everyone helped Annie with input in the group assignments throughout the semester as well (4-6). One of my main responsibilities in the fall was to work on the reward system (8), I had help from Zach and Joe in this area as well. We learned from the Zoo staff that they would like to reward the birds in some manner, we discussed a few different options such as a food or some other treat. Ultimately we learned that without tagging the birds with an RFID chip, it will be difficult to reward the birds indivudally. My other responsibility was to research possible behavioral data collection (5-6). Again, we decided without tracking the birds we cannot track indivudal behavioral data. We could however track and record interactions as a whole and learn about the Kea in this manner.

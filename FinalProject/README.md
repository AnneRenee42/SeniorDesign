### About the Project
Goal: Create an interactive experience for zoo guests and the Kea (very smart birds!) by creating a cue for the birds that indicates that if they land on a perch near the viewing window and make a response, they will get their most favorite treat!

General Outline: Have a detector of some kind under a mat that detects if a visitor is standing on it. If a person is detected, a light turns on in the enclosure. This light serves as a cue to the birds that if they go to the window and make a response, they will receive food. The response the bird has to make can be a variety of things (pull a lever, press a button, etc.). When the bird completes this response, they receive a treat. 

Key pieces: 
*	The detector of the human. 
*	The signal to the bird (presented contingent upon the person standing in the right place). 
*	The mechanism to make the response (remember, this response should ONLY produce food IF there is a person standing on the mat/the signal light is on. If the bird makes this response when the light is off, NO food should be delivered). 
*	Once the response is made at the appropriate time, food is delivered safely. 
    *	Safely meaning that whatever the response mechanism is, and whatever the food delivery system is, it needs to be safe for the birds. That is, they cannot get tangled in any string/wire, and cannot get caught in any doors/gates that might open and shut. 
*	Collecting this behavioral data is a HUGE plus for this project. We would love to keep track of who, what, and when (who left, when did they leave/enter, when did they come back?). Triple bonus if we can collect this behavioral data automatically. 

### Expectations

Our goal is that with our collective skills and majors, we will be able to accomplish the above project. We would build the sensors, and create a safe system to dispense treats for the birds. Time permitting, we would like to incorporate some of the data analytics around this project as well. For a demo, we would be able to show either a video of the project in place, or perhaps bring in a demo of the sensor and system working real time. We could also visualize and show off the dana analytics if we reach that stage.

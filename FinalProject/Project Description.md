## About the Project
Goal: Create an interactive experience for zoo guests and the Kea by creating a cue for the birds that indicates that if they land on a perch near the viewing window and make a response, they will get their most favorite treat!

General Outline: Detect when a visitor is ready to interact. Signal to the Kea with some type of indicator. Create a system that allows the Kea and visitor to interact, via a some process or game. 

Key pieces: 
*	The detector of the human. 
*	The signal to the bird
*	The process or game
*	The system must be safe for the Kea in every possible way
*	Collecting this behavioral data is a HUGE plus for this project. We would love to keep track of who, what, and when (who left, when did they leave/enter, when did they come back?). Triple bonus if we can collect this behavioral data automatically. 

## Abstract
This project intends to allow the Cincinnati zoo visitors to interact with the Kea birds. The system will need to be safe to interact with for both the guests of all ages and for the Kea. The system will be composed of two separate monitors and controllers. The intent of this project is to allow for data collection and research about the Kea birds while providing an interactive exhibit at the Zoo.

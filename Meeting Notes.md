# Meetings with Advisors
## September 4, 2019
In this meeting, we met with Katie and Dieter to discuss the project at hand. We determined that the we did want to work on this project and began to discuss the details as well as plans for our next meeting.
## September 22, 2019
On this day, we visited the Cincinnati Zoo where we met Katie in person and toured the facilities. We gained a better understanding of the birds and their capabilities as well as what the Zoo is looking for in this project. We were given access to some potentially useful hardware for our system and had the opportunity to examine the enclosure to begin to plan our system and how it will attach to the exhibit.
## October
We communicated over email to discuss the logisitcs and budget at hand for this project. Through discussion, we ended up changing our original pplan to create a Simon Says game and utilize online reposiories of pre-made games. This gives the Zoo staff a wider variety of games to one day and in to the system and allows us to focus more on the hardware and safety of the system.
## November
We continued to communicate via email, as well as a brief in person meeting to finalize the budget and create plans to utilize on campus, free facilities. We were able to get all parts ordered once this meeting was completed.
## December
Finally, In december are parts began to arrive. With our designs in hand and our change of plans in the design of the game itself, we are able to begin assembling and working on our system with the parts that we have.
## To-Do
Over symester break we plan to have the prototype finished and a game repository finalized to put us back on track with our original timeline, however the nature of the task will likely change upon second look in the Spring.

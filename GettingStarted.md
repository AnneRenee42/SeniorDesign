The goal of this project is to create an interactive game between Zoo guests and the Kea birds. With this system, the guests will have the ability to interact and learn about the Kea. The birds will will provide a source a source of information and research as we learn about their capabilities and limits.

Tutorial:
Include instructions on how to use our system here. Provide detailed instructions for the user to power on the system and select a game to play with the Kea. Include links on how to play all game options with the rules. *Note that this section is incomplete while we wait on the programming to be completed for the system.

Games:
Provide a list of games and all rules. *Note we are waiting on the programming to be in a testable state to detail the game options.

Kea:
The Kea birds are a highly intelligent species native to New Zeland. They are capable of opening locks, working together, and following instructions. The goal of this project is to train the birds to interact with Zoo guests. By doing so, we will be able to observe new information regarding the Kea. This includes whether they can see color and screens, how they think and react, and hopefully much more. 

Installation and Maintenance (for the Zoo Staff):
*This section will be updated as the system is built. Currently the system is in a demo type state and we are unsure how it will function once installed at the Zoo.

# High Level D0
-> interacts

Cincinnati Zoo Guest -> device -> Kea Birds -> Food

#Lower Level D1
A Cinncinnati Zoo guest will interact with a device that will signal the Kea birds to interact with a device to play with the guest. If the Kea wins it will recieve food and if it loses it will not get any food.

#Lowest Level D2
The device will allow guest to interact in a game with the Kea birds. If the Kea birds win they will be rewarded. The goal of this is to see the intellectual ablity of the birds.
The zoo keepers want to gather as much information as the can on the birds interacting with the device so data collection is also required

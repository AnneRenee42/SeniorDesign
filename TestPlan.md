Part 1:
Testing our project will include both a hardware and software aspect. We will focus ona few key strategies including how safe the system is for the birds to interact with, how simple the system can be maintained by untrained staff, and the ability of the common zoo guest to interact with the system. As for the software, we will mostly be working with pre-defined libraries. We will create test cases for the code we write and aim for a high percentage of code coverage.


Part 2 and Part 3: These sections are currently difficult to define as we are in the process of building our demo. We will continue to update these sections as we reach a testable product.
